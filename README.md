### To add your github profile

1. create an issue, with the title as your name, and in the description put a screenshot of the customised GitHub profile page (copy the generated image url, this will be needed in the next step)
2. in `data.json` add your own object to the end of the file, your entry should be similar to this example:

```typescript
{
    "name": "Eddie Jaoude",
    "githubUsername": "eddiejaoude",
    "imageUrl": "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/624760/91057573-48531300-e61f-11ea-9e13-2d7384e42000.png",
    "issueNumber": 66
}
